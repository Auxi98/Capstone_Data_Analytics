## **Part 2: PREPARE** <a class="anchor" id="PREPARE"></a> 

**Key tasks**

>*1. Dataset used*

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data - This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Mobius.
These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.  Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.  

>*2. Credibility of the data*

we can confirm it is open-source dataset.You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

>*3. Limitations* 

The sample size of the data is 30.No demographics or gender information is given.It cannot be used to certify that it was clear representation of the population considered (Sample Bias).Time period of the dataset is two months long and is not the current data.

>*4. Data Organization*

The dataset contains 18 .csv files. Since the data cleaning has to be repeated for 18 files,the data was viewed and organized using RStudio. Information about the Fitbit data description was found from [here](https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf)
The following Table shows the consised information.

## **Part 3: PROCESS** <a class="anchor" id="PROCESS"></a> 

**Key tasks**

>*1. Checking the data for errors*

Since the datatype of date and datetime columns were char, it was changed to the appropriate datatypes and duplicate rows were removed.Since the Table format was long format, only duplicated rows was to be removed, however **no such duplicated rows were found**.There was no need to trim as all datatypes were either numeric, date, or logical. For easier data manipulation the cleaned data was saved in the working directory as csv file with clean as suffix.

>*2. Document the cleaning process*

The process is documented here with a markdown, and the code used in RStudio is given for clarification.
Since we have to run separate queries on each table for data manipulation (SQL),I have preferred to use R for the analysis.

>*3. Data organization*

To make it consistent I have renamed the date columns as "Date" and Datetime columns as "DateTime". Further, I have separated the datetime column into 2 separate columns called 'Date' and 'Time' which makes it easier for Table join.

## **Part 4: ANALYZE** <a class="anchor" id="ANALYZE"></a> 
Since we have to run separate queries on each table for data manipulation (SQL),I have preferred to use R for the analysis.

**Key tasks**

> ##  *1. Summary - To get an idea of the information stored in each table*

I have run a code to get the no. of unique users in each table and checked the time frame of the recorderd acticities.The consised result with the identified interesting trends is saved to a table.

> **Observations:**
* 1. The time period is consistent in all tables however the users using Heartrate , sleep and weight monitoring are less than normal.
* 2. There is no missing values except 65 missing values in 'Fat' column in 'sleepDay_merged' Table.
* 3. By viewing the 3 tables with fewer entries the following observations were made:
                * Since the users were less than 30(24) people for sleep data, **no correlation is possible** between their state of sleep or sleep duration.
                * The weight has been manually inputted more (41 / 67 entries), which could mean **difficulty in the means of inputting the weight**.
                * Since the users were less than 30(8) people for weight data, **no correlation is possible** between their weight and no. of entries or frequency of entries.
                * Heart rate values recorded by the Fitbit device - A variable sampling technique controls the frequency at which heart rate is recorded. Devices will sample heart rate every 5 to 15 seconds on average. However, it is noted that only 14 users have their heartrate recorded.**It could be that the device was not functioning properly or the users was not wearing it properly**

> ##  *2. Log details  -  To understand user logging patterns*

By checking if any other data has been given about manual or automatic entry / logging , several activities was found and viewed for any correlation.

By Fitbit’s SmartTrack feature activities can be tracked in 4 ways:

*tracker* = activity logs are those created using the multisport exercise mode on a Fitbit device.

*manual* = activity logs are user specified overrides of some or all tracker data.

*fitstar*= activity logs are created after completing a FitStar workout.

*mobile_run* activity logs are created after completing a MobileRun.

From the data provided, the following data are related to this issue 
1. LoggedActivitiesDistance - Total kilometres from logged activities. - Daily Activity
2. IsManualReport - If the data for this weight in was done manually (TRUE), or if data was measured and synched directly to Fitbit.com from a connected scale (FALSE) - Weight Log Minutes

(Checked using Filter and sort in Excel)


| Table Name           | Column Name              | % of entries         | No. of Users |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| dailyActivity_merged | LoggedActivitiesDistance | 3 (32 / 940 entries) |4             |
| weightLogInfo_merged | IsManualReport           | 61 (41 / 67 entries) |5             |

> ##  *3. User retention -  To understand users across various functions*

To understand the user retention across various functions of Fitbit and across the time period, I have joined the following tables to get the no. of users for the various functions of Fitbit and its time period. I have used R to sort and filter the following data for further analysis

1)Daily Activity merged

2)Sleep day merged

3)WeightLogInfo merged

4)Heartrateseconds merged

The sorted files are imported into Google Looker for further data visualization.

> ##  *4. Daily Usage Timing -  To understand user's preference in wearing the Fitbit*

I have studied the timings of the records for individual functions to get better insights on when the users are utilizing them.**(Done in LOOKER)**

## **Part 5: SHARE** <a class="anchor" id="SHARE"></a> 
I have done the data visualization in Looker and made a dashboard to be shared.
https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/l9wtNOqLFUI

I have made use of control elements so that the user can filter and view for themselves in Google Looker.
## **Part 6: ACT** <a class="anchor" id="ACT"></a> 

> **Concluding Insights**
1) The heartrate tracker is used less even though people have used the automatic step tracker

2) Users are less inclined to use manual logging for steps.

3) For recording weight , users have used mostly manual entry among the very few users

4) The average users is very less in weight tracker followed by heartrate Tracker.

5) Weight tracking is done either at the early morning or at late night.

6) Heartrate monitor is used mostly at night during sleep hours


> **Initial Hypothesis**
1) Users are more likely to use the functions it is automatically detects the acticities.

2) Sync with other apps or devices (weighing scale) makes it more usable.

3) Heartrate monitor is used while sleeping more , can be made more efficient./ The device is not comfortable/working to use in the morning.

> **Recommendation**

*Further study using a large dataset is needed about why people are less likely to use a particular function of Fitbit* However the following points can be considered as a recommendation.

**Product Recommendation: Smart Device Fitness Tracker**

1. Enhance Automatic Activity Detection: 
Since users are more inclined to use functions that automatically detect activities (like the step tracker), it is crucial to improve the accuracy and efficiency of automatic activity detection in the smart device fitness tracker. This will make it more convenient for users to track their workouts and daily activities without the need for manual input.

2. Integrate with Other Devices: 
The data indicates that users prefer manual entry for weight tracking and rely less on the heartrate tracker. To encourage more usage of these features, consider integrating the smart device fitness tracker with other devices, such as a weighing scale or a smartwatch, to make the tracking process seamless and effortless for users.

3. Optimize Weight Tracking Experience: 
Since weight tracking is primarily done in the early morning or late at night, focus on improving the user experience during these times. This could involve sending reminders or notifications to encourage users to log their weight regularly and provide helpful tips or motivation to maintain a consistent routine.

4. Improve Sleep Heart Rate Monitoring: 
Given that the heartrate monitor is used mostly at night during sleep hours, invest in research and development to enhance the efficiency and comfort of the heartrate monitoring feature. Ensure that the device is comfortable to wear while sleeping and that it provides accurate and insightful data to help users understand their sleep patterns better.

**Other Recommedation that could be taken after further studies:**

1. Educational Content and Resources: 
Provide valuable educational content and resources related to fitness, nutrition, mental health, and self-care within the app or website. Educating users about the importance of various health aspects and how the smart device fitness tracker can help monitor and improve these areas will encourage regular usage and brand loyalty.

2. Customized Insights and Goal Tracking: 
Implement personalized insights and goal tracking features based on the data collected from the smart device fitness tracker. Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and provide tailored recommendations, challenges, and goals to keep users engaged and motivated on their fitness journey.

3. Promote Social Engagement: 
Create a social platform within the Bellabeat app or website where users can connect, share their progress, and participate in challenges or competitions. This social engagement will foster a sense of community, motivation, and accountability among users, leading to increased usage and retention.

4. Target Women's Health and Wellness: 
As Bellabeat is focused on health products for women, tailor the marketing strategy to highlight the unique features and benefits of the smart device fitness tracker for women's health and wellness. Emphasize how the device can assist women in tracking their fitness, reproductive health, stress levels, and overall well-being.
